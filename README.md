## Recognition
VXMusic currently supports two Music Recognition services, **Shazam**, and **AudD.io**.

- Shazam is the recommended API to use, as it has the most rich recognition database and metadata.

- AudD.io doesn't have the same rich data experience, but it runs a lot faster than Shazam. The speed is negligible in the grand scheme of things.

### BYO API Keys
VXMusic allows you to "bring-your-own" API Key for Music Recognition Services.

This is super easy to set up, and more importantly, **FREE!**

See the instructions below on how to get your own API keys.

#### Shazam
1. Navigate to: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam
2. Sign in with Google, or an alternative login method.
3. Navigate back to: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam
4. On the top right, hit Subscribe to Test

6. Hit "Subscribe"

7. From the Shazam API page, click one of the Endpoints on the left

8. Under "Code Snippets" on the right, copy the API Key under "x-rapidapi-key"

<img src=".github/readme/GrabTheApiKeyOnTheRight.png" alt="VXMusic Desktop" width="60%">

8. In VXMusic, on the Recognition tab, paste this key into the Api Key box.
